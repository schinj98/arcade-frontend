        <p>Welcome to ArcadeTrack — your ultimate tool to <strong>calculate arcade points</strong> from Google Cloud’s Arcade program. If you're actively participating in Google Cloud Arcade program or Google Facilitator Program, knowing how your efforts convert into <strong>Arcade Points</strong> can help you win exciting prizes and swag!</p>
        <h2>🎯 What Are Google Cloud Arcade Points?</h2>
        <p>Google Cloud’s Arcade program rewards learners and developers for completing hands-on labs, Games, and Trivia on the <a href="https://go.cloudskillsboost.google/arcade/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Arcade platform</a>. These actions grant points, which are redeemable for prizes and leaderboard rankings.</p>
        <h2>🔢 How Are Arcade Points Calculated?</h2>
        <p>Here’s a basic idea of how your activities translate into points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ Completing a <strong>Skill Lab</strong>: 0.5 point</li>
            <li>✅ Completing a <strong>Trivia</strong>: 1 point</li>
            <li>✅ Completing a <strong>Games</strong>: 1-2 points</li>
            <li>✅ Completing a <strong>Free labs</strong>: 0 points</li>
